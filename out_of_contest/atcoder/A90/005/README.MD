# Statement
How many N-digit positive integers that can be constructed by using only the digits $c_1, c_2,...,c_K$ that are multiples of B? Since the answer can be really big, take the mod of $10^9 + 7$.

# Constraints
- $1 \le K \le 9$
- $1 \le c_1 < c2 < ... < c_K \le 9$
- $1 \le N \le 10^{18}$
- $2 \le B \le 1000$
- All inputs given are integers
