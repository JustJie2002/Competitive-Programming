# [Yokan Party (4 stars)](https://atcoder.jp/contests/typical90/tasks/typical90_a)
There is a yokan whose total length is L [cm]. It has N cuts, the i-th cut is at position A$_i$ [cm] from the left.

You want to choose K cuts out of the N cuts and divide the Yokan into K + 1 pieces. We calculate the score after cuts as the minimum length of the pieces. What will be the score if we try to maximize it?

# Constraints
- $1 \le K \le N \le 100,000$
- $0 < A_1 < A_2 < ... < A_N < L \le 10^9$
- All inputs given are integers
